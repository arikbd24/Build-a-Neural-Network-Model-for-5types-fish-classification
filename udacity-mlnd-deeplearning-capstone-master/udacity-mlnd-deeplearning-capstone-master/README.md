# Udacity-mlnd-deeplearning-capstone

Transfer Learning with VGG16 neural network architecture on multi-class fish classification problem with data from [Nature Conservancy Fishery Monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring)
Competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The final model yilds 1.19 log-loss in the leaderboard with a top-45% ranking currently(so far my best one:D)

The final report with model visualizations and validation plots is [here](https://github.com/Tahsin-Mayeesha/udacity-mlnd-deeplearning-capstone/blob/master/capstone%20final%20report.pdf)

# Dependencies : 

* Python 2.7+/3.5
* keras ```pip install keras```
* tensorflow ```pip install tensorflow```

Note that keras and tensorflow have their own dependencies. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org") for handlinng the packages.

# Usage : 

* Download data from Kaggle
* Use Train-Validation Split Notebook to split train data into proper directories
* Read the capstone-final report for understanding the approaches taken in solving this problem
* Notebooks are under the "notebooks" folder and scripts are under the "scripts" folder. 
* All the model diagrams and performance charts are provided.
